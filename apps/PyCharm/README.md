# PyCharm 2026.2.3 (Intune Win32 app)

Installs PyCharm 2026.2.3 for all users and makes Python 3.14 the default interpreter in
PyCharm for every user on the device. Users don't see PyCharm's first-run User Agreement or
Data Sharing dialogs, or the Windows Firewall prompt.

Python comes from the separate [Python 3.14](../Python-3.14/) app. Set it up as a dependency
(below), so Intune installs Python first.

The hash matches JetBrains' published `pycharm-2026.2.3.exe.sha256`.

## Build the package

```sh
python3 tools/build.py PyCharm
# -> out/PyCharm/Install.intunewin
```

GitHub Actions also builds it whenever a push changes this folder, and publishes it as the
**PyCharm-2026.2.3** artifact. See the [repo README](../../README.md).

### Dependency on Python 3.14

1. Add the [Python 3.14](../Python-3.14/) app to Intune first.
2. In this app, go to **Dependencies → Add** and pick Python 3.14.7.
3. Set **Automatically install** to **Yes**.

Intune then installs Python before PyCharm, and assigning PyCharm is enough; you don't need
to assign Python separately. Uninstalling PyCharm leaves Python installed.

If Python is missing when PyCharm installs, the install still succeeds and logs a warning,
but users don't get Python 3.14 as their default interpreter. Active Setup only runs once per
user, so installing Python later doesn't fix that. You'd need to bump `$ActiveSetupVersion`
in `Install.ps1` and redeploy.

A Python patch release (for example 3.14.8) installs to the same `C:\Program Files\Python314`,
so only the Python app needs updating. Moving to Python 3.15 changes the path, so update both
apps then.

## What the install does

[`source/Install.ps1`](source/Install.ps1), running as SYSTEM:

1. **PyCharm 2026.2.3**: `pycharm-2026.2.3.exe /S /CONFIG=silent.config /D=C:\Program Files\JetBrains\PyCharm 2026.2.3`.
   [`silent.config`](source/silent.config) sets `mode=admin` (all users) and turns off the desktop
   shortcut, PATH change, context menu entry and `.py` association.
2. **Firewall**: adds an inbound rule for `bin\pycharm64.exe` (group `PyCharm 2026.2.3`), so
   Windows doesn't ask users whether to let PyCharm through. The rule **blocks** by default.
   PyCharm's own features (debugger, built-in web server) talk over localhost, which Windows
   Firewall doesn't filter, so they still work. Set `$FirewallAction = 'Allow'` in
   `Install.ps1` if users need to reach PyCharm from another computer.
3. **Per-user defaults, future logons**: copies
   [`Set-PyCharmUserDefaults.ps1`](source/Set-PyCharmUserDefaults.ps1) to
   `C:\Program Files\JetBrains\PyCharm-Python-Defaults\` (only admins can write there) and
   registers it with **Active Setup**, so Windows runs it once for each user at their next logon.
4. **Per-user defaults, now**: runs the same script as SYSTEM against every existing profile
   under `C:\Users`, so users who are already signed in don't need to log off.

If the script is invoked on a 32-bit PowerShell (which the Intune Management Extension can
do), it relaunches itself as 64-bit so `Program Files` and `HKLM` aren't redirected.

## First-run prompts

`Set-PyCharmUserDefaults.ps1` stores the same answers PyCharm saves when a user clicks through
its first-run dialogs. The locations and formats were confirmed in the 2026.2.3 build
(`EndUserAgreement`, `ConsentOptions`, `com.intellij.ide.Prefs`).

| Prompt | What the script sets |
|---|---|
| JetBrains User Agreement | `HKCU\Software\JavaSoft\Prefs\jetbrains\privacy_policy`, value `eua_accepted_version` = `2.0`. PyCharm 2026.2 ships version 2.0 of the agreement; if a later build ships a newer one, users are asked again until `-AgreementVersion` is updated. |
| Data Sharing | Adds `rsch.send.usage.stat:1.1:0:<time>` ("Don't Send") to `%APPDATA%\JetBrains\consentOptions\accepted`. All JetBrains IDEs share this file, so an answer the user already gave is left alone. Pass `-UsageStatistics Allow` to opt in instead. |

Accepting the User Agreement this way accepts it on each user's behalf. Make sure your
organization is comfortable with that under its JetBrains licensing terms.

The registry part needs the user's registry hive. For users who are signed in during install,
it is loaded under `HKEY_USERS`, and the SYSTEM pass writes there. Everyone else gets it from
Active Setup at their next logon, before they can start PyCharm.

## How the default interpreter is set

PyCharm has no machine-wide interpreter setting. Interpreters live in each user's config
folder, `%APPDATA%\JetBrains\PyCharm2026.2\options\`. `Set-PyCharmUserDefaults.ps1` writes
three files there:

| File | What the script sets |
|---|---|
| `jdk.table.xml` | Adds a `Python SDK` entry named **Python 3.14** for `C:\Program Files\Python314\python.exe` (flavor `WinPythonSdkFlavor`). If an entry for that `python.exe` already exists, it reuses that entry. If another interpreter already uses the name, it picks `Python 3.14 (2)`. |
| `project.default.xml` | Points the default project's `ProjectRootManager` at that SDK, so new projects and projects opened without an interpreter get Python 3.14.7. |
| `pySdk.xml` | Sets `PySdkSettings.PREFERRED_VIRTUALENV_BASE_SDK` to that `python.exe`, so the New Project wizard picks Python 3.14.7 as the base interpreter when it creates a new venv. |

It edits these files in place and keeps the rest of their contents. Running it again changes
nothing.

**Keeping settings from older PyCharm versions.** The first time a user starts PyCharm 2026.2,
it offers to import settings from their previous version (for example `PyCharm2026.1`). Two
details of that import, confirmed in the 2026.2.3 build (`ConfigImportHelper`, `InitialConfigImportState`):

- PyCharm only treats the config folder as already set up, and skips the import, when
  `options\other.xml`, `options\ide.general.xml` or `options\options.xml` exists. The script
  never writes those files, so the import still happens.
- During the import, PyCharm skips any file that already exists in the new folder. On its own,
  that would mean the user's older interpreter list and new-project defaults were not brought
  across. So when the 2026.2 folder hasn't been set up yet, the script starts from the newest
  older `PyCharm*`/`PyCharmCE*` copy of each file and then adds Python 3.14.7. The user keeps
  their old interpreters and also gets the new default.

**Caveats**

- If PyCharm is running while the SYSTEM pass edits a user's files, PyCharm overwrites them
  when it exits. Active Setup runs at logon, before PyCharm can start, so it covers anyone
  this affects at their next logon. To make Active Setup run again for everyone, bump
  `$ActiveSetupVersion` in `Install.ps1`.
- With folder redirection of `AppData\Roaming`, the SYSTEM pass writes to the local profile
  path. Active Setup still writes to the user's real `%APPDATA%` at their next logon.
- Existing projects keep whatever interpreter they already use. The default only applies to
  new projects.

## Uninstall

[`source/Uninstall.ps1`](source/Uninstall.ps1) stops PyCharm, runs `bin\Uninstall.exe /S` and
waits for it to finish, then removes the firewall rule, the Active Setup entry and the defaults
script. Python 3.14 stays installed, and users' own PyCharm settings in `%APPDATA%` are left
alone.
