# Python 3.14.7 (Intune Win32 app)

Installs 64-bit Python 3.14.7 for all users in `C:\Program Files\Python314`, adds it to the
system PATH, and installs the `py` launcher. Other apps can depend on it, such as
[PyCharm](../PyCharm/).

There are no scripts. Intune runs the Python installer directly, since its command-line options
cover everything and its exit codes are the standard ones Intune already understands.

The hash matches the `sha256_sum` python.org publishes for this file.

## Build the package

```sh
python3 tools/build.py Python-3.14
# -> out/Python-3.14/python-3.14.7-amd64.intunewin
```

GitHub Actions also builds it whenever a push changes this folder, and publishes it as the
**Python-3.14-3.14.7** artifact. See the [repo README](../../README.md).

## Intune app settings

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| App type | Windows app (Win32) |
| Package file | `python-3.14.7-amd64.intunewin` |
| Name | Python 3.14.7 |
| Publisher | Python Software Foundation |
| Install command | `python-3.14.7-amd64.exe /quiet InstallAllUsers=1 TargetDir="C:\Program Files\Python314" PrependPath=1 Include_launcher=1 InstallLauncherAllUsers=1 Include_test=0 /log "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\IntuneManagementExtension\Logs\Python-3.14.7-Install.log"` |
| Uninstall command | `python-3.14.7-amd64.exe /quiet /uninstall /log "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\IntuneManagementExtension\Logs\Python-3.14.7-Uninstall.log"` |
| Install behavior | System |
| Device restart behavior | Determine behavior based on return codes |
| Return codes | defaults |
| OS architecture | x64 |
| Minimum OS | Windows 10 21H2 or later |
| Disk space required | 500 MB |
| Detection rules | Registry rule, below |

### Detection rule

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Rule type | Registry |
| Key path | `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore\3.14` |
| Value name | `Version` |
| Detection method | String comparison |
| Operator | Equals |
| Value | `3.14.7` |
| Associated with a 32-bit app on 64-bit clients | No |

The installer writes this key for all-users installs (PEP 514).

### What the install options do

| Option | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/quiet` | No UI |
| `InstallAllUsers=1` | Installs for everyone, not just the account running it |
| `TargetDir="C:\Program Files\Python314"` | The folder PyCharm is configured to use. Patch releases install to the same folder. |
| `PrependPath=1` | Adds Python and its `Scripts` folder to the system PATH |
| `Include_launcher=1 InstallLauncherAllUsers=1` | Installs the `py` launcher for all users |
| `Include_test=0` | Leaves out the standard library's test suite |
| `/log "..."` | Writes the installer log where Intune's "Collect diagnostics" picks it up |

pip, file associations and Start menu shortcuts are included by default.

## Updating to a new 3.14 patch release

Patch releases install over this one in the same folder, so apps that point at
`C:\Program Files\Python314\python.exe` keep working. To update:
1. Change the URL, hash, version and `setupFile` in `app.json`.
2. Build it, and add it to Intune as a new app with the new file name and version in the
   commands and detection rule.
3. Set it to supersede this app, with **Uninstall previous version** set to **No**.

## Future: Python 3.16 and the install manager

Checked September 2026 against [PEP 773](https://peps.python.org/pep-0773/) and the
[Python 3.14 Windows docs](https://docs.python.org/3.14/using/windows.html):

- The installer this app uses is deprecated since 3.14 and "will not be produced for Python
  3.16 or later". Python 3.15 still ships it (3.15.0rc2 has `python-3.15.0rc2-amd64.exe`).
- Its replacement, the Python install manager (`py install`), "does not support installing
  runtimes per-machine". It installs Python separately for each signed-in user. The docs
  suggest emulating a per-machine install by running `py install --target=<shared location>`
  as an administrator and adding PATH, registry and Start menu entries yourself.
- The `py` launcher this app installs (`Include_launcher=1`) is deprecated too; the install
  manager replaces it.

So this app can stay as it is through Python 3.15. For 3.16, it will likely become a scripted
app: install the install manager, run `py install --target="C:\Program Files\Python316"` as
SYSTEM, and add PATH and detection by hand. Keeping a fixed path means
[PyCharm](../PyCharm/)'s default-interpreter setup keeps working. Check the docs again before
then, since machine-wide support may improve.

## Uninstall

The uninstall command runs the same installer with `/uninstall`. Packages installed with pip
into `C:\Program Files\Python314` go with it. Apps that depend on Python stay installed.
